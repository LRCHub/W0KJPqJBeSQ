Power!
Power Two!
You're my power two
Gotta scream, you're my energy to live on
GO!
Baby now
Do I ever tell you my emotions
I bet that you know girl
How I'd rather dive into the ocean
Let me tell you what a fever
Baby you're my mind's revolution
You can set my heart all open wide
You just go go go!
Oh baby
You're my power two
And I get my kicks just out of you
You're my power two
You're nothing more, you are nothing less than heaven
You're my power two
Every time you come out of the blue
You're my power two
Gotta scream, you're my energy to live on
Right, alright
Each tomorrow I just need your sweet kiss
I say you can't deny
Electricity of love between us
Let me tell you what a fever
Baby you're my mind's revolution
You can set my heart all open wide
You just go go go!
You're my power two
And I get my kicks just out of you
You're my power two
You're nothing more, you are nothing less than heaven
You're my power two
Every time you come out of the blue
You're my power two
Gotta scream, you're my energy to live on
Power!
Power Two!
You're my power two
And I get my kicks just out of you
You're my power two
You're nothing more
You're my power two
And I get my kicks just out of you
You're my power two
You're nothing more, you are nothing less than heaven
You're my power two
Every time you come out of the blue
You're my power two
Gotta scream, you're my energy to live on
Power!
